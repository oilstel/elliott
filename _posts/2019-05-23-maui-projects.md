I've been thinking a lot about Maui and the Hawaiian islands in general. Mostly about name spaces and how Hawaii doesn't have much of a digital identity that speaks to the values and needs of the local community. I suppose theres the newspaper but nothing that really speaks from the people. But also I think that the idea of putting an island online is pretty colonist as well.

I suppose a personal approach is best here.
