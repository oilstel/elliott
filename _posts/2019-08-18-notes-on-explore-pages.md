I read a [post](https://docs.sendwithses.com/random-stuff/the-internet-is-an-seo-landfill) awhile back about how SEO and search engine ranking algorithms have created a landfill of useless search results across search engines. It's true that there was a pretty dramatic shift in searching the web after these "optimizations" took place. In the early days of search, it felt more like exploring the vastness of the web instead of being served results that seemed relevant to your search profile. It's interesting how there's been an overwhelming amount of research and money put into search, but very few projects have focused on building new methods of exploring the web.

A trend across social media platforms at the moment has been the implementation of "explore" tabs/pages. Usually these are just feeds, curated "staff picks" lists, or personalized suggestion pages. A feed is based around time, usually sorted reverse chronologically, whereas an explore page reveals the vastness of a website by pulling from multiple sources, allowing one to jump directly into the depths of a platform. Personalized suggestion feeds like Instagram's explore tab are not really explore pages either because they are curated around a user's social profile. Being fed similar images based on your likes isn't the same as exploring the vastness of a platform. Explore pages are unique in that they unearth things that are not necessarily the most popular or the most recent. In doing so, users must approach exploring with an open mind and without expectations. Most importantly, explore pages should make you feel a sense of excitement similar to the feeling of exploring a new place.

When I worked at [The Creative Independent](https://indp.co), we talked about creating an explore page, but we never got far enough along on the idea to define what the page would actually look like. One thing we did implement early on was a [random button](https://thecreativeindependent.com/random/) that served up a random interview from over 600 articles on the site. I ended up moving this button into the main navigation so that readers could continue to click the button until they found an interview that interested them. Though this was an interesting way of exploring the vastness of the site, it still didn't address the explore page experience we were looking for.

**Randomization as explore page**

It's fairly easy to implement a "randomized items/articles" section on a website. As seen on The Creative Independent, this simple idea can easily reveal how expansive a site is.

In 2008 I came across the site [Muxtape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muxtape), which was the original "mixtape on the web" website. It allowed you to upload MP3s from your computer and curate the tracks into a "muxtape". Though the site was eventually shut down, I often think about one key design decision. Muxtape's homepage had a "Random active muxtapes" section that changed on refresh. This simple randomized section gave users a way to explore muxtapes across the website.

Interestingly, this feature alone replaced the need for a search. The site became centered around exploring mixes instead of searching for a particular mix or a song. I remember spending hours refreshing the homepage, clicking through to a mix, listening, and heading back to the homepage to find another. I've never experienced anything like this on a website. It truly felt I was like exploring a vast archive similar to the experience of wandering through a book store and randomly choosing a title from a shelf. It was a completely new experience and it all came from a simple random function.

Though I doubt anything like Muxtape will ever exist again, I don't think the simple idea of exploring a website through randomization has to be completely lost. This simple design decision showed how useful randomization can be without any sort of curation or personalization.

In the last few years, platforms have stripped away any notion of how vast they actually are. As a result, what users see is tiny sliver of an entire platform. There's been an overwhelming push to build tools specifically designed for engagement (likes, emoji responses, commenting) instead of building tools that help users explore on a platform. This has replaced any sense of play with a bleak urgency. The marketing line could easily be, "engage more, play less". I'd like to propose that we begin designing with vastness in mind again. The data is already there, all we have to do as platform architects and designers is to build tools that allow for more exploration and play.
