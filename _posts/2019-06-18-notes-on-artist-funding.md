Some thoughts on Patreon and Drip...

I feel like these platforms are catering to a very particular kind of artist, an artist who has an audience that is willing to pay for their content and not just view it. I suppose the Patreon artist is something YouTube helped create, an artist created by the audience for the audience. I just wonder how these platforms help artists that are not YouTube stars or musicians.
