    .number {
        margin: 1em 0 1em;
        border: 3px solid #a8c8ff;
        border-radius: 100%;
        font-size: 200%;
        padding: 10px;
        display: block;
        text-align: center;
    }
</style>

*Update: I realized soon after posting this that I had to revise the rules. Instead of makes 4 websites per month, I will be publishing 4 projects per month. A "project" could just a some writing on this very blog or a series of photographs taken in a park.*

I'm passionate about personal websites and constantly have ideas for them. Instead of logging those ideas away, I'm hoping that for the next few months I can just make the ~~websites~~ projects I dream up. Often I get caught on something simple like choosing a domain name. ~~Instead of fussing over the details, I will be hosting each site here unless an obvious name immediately comes to mind.~~

*Some constraints (to follow or break):*
- Each ~~website~~ project should be simple enough to finish in a few days time.
- It would be nice if each project challenged me in a different way, but this is also not completely necessary. I'd rather finish each project instead of agonizing over the tooling.
- I'll document my progress in this post.

Stay tuned...

I rebuilt my studio site, [Bell Kiosk](http://bellkiosk.site). Each website is represented by a bell. You can ring all the bells from the homepage.

I've wanted to setup a webcam since I was a kid. This month I finally bought an Axis security camera and opened a port on my router. If its plugged in, you should see a live feed above.
