Today we went back to our favorite beach called Agios Georgios. A steep dirt road leads to a small taverna. The hippie decor reminds me of [Paia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paia,_Hawaii) but much smaller and less touristy. The path down to the taverna has a fountain made of variously sized plastic wash basins. Water cascades from each basin and there are little turtles swimming in some of the tubs.

Agios Georgios is a pebble beach. Visiting a pebble beach is like a witnessing a very special time in someone's life. Soon, in maybe a hundred years, the pebbles will be fine sand. It’s nice to catch this in between phase. Pebble beaches are also great for swimming. The water is very clear and it’s easy to enter and exit.

In Greece most beaches have tavernas. This taverna is built into the side of the cliff yet is only a few feet from the beach. There are two ways of entering the taverna, through the main path or a side path. This side path has a small shower, restroom, and changing room that is open to the public but still part of the taverna. The shower is solar heated. Taking a hot shower at the beach is a unique experience.

The taverna serves a variety of Greek dishes. Our favorites were a beetroot garlic dish and a spicy cheese dip. The beet dish is just beetroot sliced and seasoned with parsley, garlic, salt, and olive oil/vinegar. We’ve found that the simplest of dishes here are incredible.

I told Lily today that people here really know how to go to the beach. We’ve been admiring how the tavernas make the experience of going to the beach infinitely better with shade, water, and food readily available.

<!-- Lately I’ve been thinking about the infrastructure and in different cities. Last month, when I was in Osaka, city infrastructure was also on my mind. In Japan the trains are extremely accessible but also things like biking are much safer and easier to do than in New York. Through out Osaka, the sidewalks are wide and have a median. One side is for walking while the other is for bikes. The ability to bike on the sidewalk makes biking in the city so much easier and safer.

In Greece, they have their own unique transportation differences too. Cars are the preferred mode of transit through out much of the country and the surrounding islands. On the main highways and even on side streets drivers will drive in the shoulder of the road. Almost everyone does this. It seems that the shoulder acts as a slow lane since most highways in Greece only have one lane. Drivers that want to go faster will pass drivers that are hanging in the shoulder lane. At first this approach to driving (driving half off the road) is somewhat frightening, but soon I realized that it is useful for drivers in a rush and eliminates much of the stress of driving at the speed limit on the highway. There’s also a heightened awareness when driving on the side of the road. Often a tree will reach into the shoulder and you’ll have to move back into the regular lane. -->
