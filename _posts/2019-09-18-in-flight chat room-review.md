On my flight's entertainment system there’s a "talk" feature. Tapping this button shows three options: "seat-to-seat", "chat room", and "help." Tapping "seat-to-seat" displays a cross-section of the plane (5 columns / 3 rows). At the bottom, it says:

<p style="border: 1px dotted {{ page.color }}; padding: 10px; border-radius: 10px;">
    Select any available seat to invite the passenger to chat.<br />
    Passengers available: 185<br />
    Passengers invited: 0
</p>

There’s an option to view all seating rows on the plane. I’m sitting in 14A. I start a chat with 20C. Unfortunately, I soon realize that there’s no on-screen keyboard. The handset with a keyboard built-in to it's back is permanently stuck in the armrest so there’s really no option to chat. Not sure if it’s a defective remote or the airline glued the remotes into the armrests so that passengers don’t steal them. I’m sorry for the radio silence 20C. I wish I could have spoken to you. I had so many things to say.

Although my attempt at using the airplane's chat room was a failure, I'd rather just make some notes about the potential of a chat room on an airplane.

There’s something intrinsically appealing about chatting online with another human that is sitting in the same enclosed space, breathing the same recycled air. In most situations, where strangers are gathered together, there’s really no reason to start a conversation, and even if you do, there's always the risk that they might never stop talking to you. Chat rooms are great because you can just log off or mute them if things go bad.

In some ways, an airplane is a perfect place for a chat room. There’s really no need to have one in the air but the idea is interesting for a few reasons...

**Something to do**

There’s not a lot to do on a plane. You could watch a movie, read a book, work, or you could chat with a complete stranger. In a lot of cases, I think I would opt for the chat room. The idea is so strange and the proximity so disorientating that it's kind of compelling. You are chatting with another human in an enclosed bubble at 30,000 feet. What would you even talk about? The weather? The clouds outside?

I like flying because it can make you feel like the whole world is far away, which is pretty much true. Also, airplane space is a bit different from land space. Up in the air, locked in a floating capsule, you have to make the best out of the experience. Who are you going to befriend up here if things take a turn for the worst? You and 185 other strangers are suddenly accountable to one another. You could act like an entirely different person up here. No one would even know.

**On accountability...**

In the plane's in-flight chat world, there’s some accountability based on your seat number without your real name being revealed. This is important because privacy and responsibility are more or less intact. It's hard to think of a platform that offers both of these things in "land space."

I’m chatting with 20C so its unlikely that that 20C is going to say something really vulgar or crazy because we are sitting in the same space. You could literally walk over to their seat or a flight attendant could. There’s also a pretty incriminating log on the plane’s computer of whatever is said in the chat room (though this would be a breach of passenger's privacy if viewed).

**Worldbuilding**

This concept is maybe what I like most about an in-flight chat room. Wordbuilding is a term often used when talking about gameplay but I think it applies here. The airplane creates a new world. This new world is small and made up of 185 other humans. It would be hard for anyone to get 185 of their followers on social media to all get together in real life. Obviously, people don’t necessarily want to fly on a plane together, but it’s nice to think of the positive aspects of flying together. Everyone on this plane has a few basic similarities:

- We are all traveling. We are in the process of going somewhere. Maybe it's home or visiting a new place.
- We are stuck in this capsule together.
- We are all humans (unless there's an animal on-board and in that case, they can use their own in-flight chat room).

That's actually a lot of similarities if you think about it and probably enough to get a few substantive conversations going. Here are some things to get the conversation going if you ever get stuck on an airplane with a chat room:

<p style="border: 1px dotted {{ page.color }}; padding: 10px; border-radius: 10px;">
Hello fellow travelers, what are your final destinations?
</p>

<p style="border: 1px dotted {{ page.color }}; padding: 10px; border-radius: 10px;">
Did you see that big cloud out the right window? Kinda looks like a fish. Wdyt?
</p>

<p style="border: 1px dotted {{ page.color }}; padding: 10px; border-radius: 10px;">
How many miles do you have?
</p>

<p style="border: 1px dotted {{ page.color }}; padding: 10px; border-radius: 10px;">
What’s in the plane's water? Pretty good stuff. Maybe it's the altitude?
</p>

<p style="border: 1px dotted {{ page.color }}; padding: 10px; border-radius: 10px;">
What’s your favorite flying beverage?
</p>

<p style="border: 1px dotted {{ page.color }}; padding: 10px; border-radius: 10px;">
Any plans after this flight. Another flight?
</p>

<p style="border: 1px dotted {{ page.color }}; padding: 10px; border-radius: 10px;">
What’s your favorite airport?
</p>

<p style="border: 1px dotted {{ page.color }}; padding: 10px; border-radius: 10px;">
What do you think of this airplane chat? Do you use chat apps regularly?
</p>

Well, that’s all for now. This didn't really end up being a review of the in-flight chat system beacuse of technical difficulties... more like of pondering the potential of intimate chat systems in the real world. The captain told us that we will be landing soon and that we will all need to log off the chat room. See you on the next flight.
