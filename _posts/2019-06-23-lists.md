My original post was formed around making 4 website a month. That challenge is a bit extreme and and now that I've had some time to work through the idea, it was not exactly what I had in mind.

Instead I'd like to challenge myself to make lists. Search engines have failed us in many ways. What remains is a big need for curated link lists. I'm still thinking how this should take form but in the mean time I'll publish this lists here.

A good list can't be too specific and at the same time it shouldn't be too general. How does one begin to write a list? What research does one need to do? How much time does it take.

knowledge lists

Some list ideas:
* A list of poetic apps
* A list of markdown apps
* A list of CMS's
