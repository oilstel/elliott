<!--I read a [post](https://docs.sendwithses.com/random-stuff/the-internet-is-an-seo-landfill) the other day about how SEO and search engine ranking algorithms have created a landfill of useless search results across search engines. I found myself trying to remember what search used to be like on the web. Instead of receiving personalized search results, you'd get a wide range of sites, including many that didn't particularly match your search query. It felt more like exploring the vastness of the web instead of being fed results that seemed relevant to my search profile. There's been an overwhelming amount of research and money put into search, but very few projects have focused on building new and interesting methods of exploring the web.-->

When I worked at [The Creative Independent](https://indp.co), we talked about creating an explore page, but we never got far enough along on this idea to define what this page would actually look like. One thing we did implement early on was a random button that simply served up a random interview from over 600 articles on the site. I ended up moving this button into the main navigation, so that readers could continue to click the button until they found an interview that interested them. Though this was an interesting way of exploring the vastness of the site, it still didn't address the explore page experience we were looking for.

What exactly is an explore page? Feeds or personalized suggestion pages are commonly mistaken for explore pages or even mislabeled as explore pages, though I believe these are very different things. A feed is based around time, most often ordered reverse chronologically, whereas an explore page shows the vastness of a website by pulling from multiple sources, allowing one to jump directly into the depths of a website. Personalized suggestion feeds like instagram's explore tab are not true explore pages because their are curated to your tastes/social profile. Being fed similar images based on your likes isn't the same as exploring the vastness of a website or platform. 

Explore pages are unique in that they unearth things that are not necessarily the most recent or the most popular. In doing so users must approach exploring with an open-mind. Most importantly, explore pages should give you the feeling of exploring a new place.

**Randomization as explore page**

It's fairly easy to implement a "randomized items/articles" section on a website. This simple idea can easily reveal the vastness of a site.

In 2008 I came across the site Muxtape, which was the original "mixtape on the web" website. It allowed you to upload MP3s from your computer and curate the tracks into a "muxtape". Though the site was eventually shutdown, I often think about a few key design decisions that Muxtape made.

Muxtape's homepage had a "Random active muxtapes" section that changed on refresh. This simple randomized section gave users a way of exploring random muxtapes on the website. Interestingly, this feature alone replaced the need for a search. The site became centered around exploring mixes instead of searching for a particular mix or a song. I remember spending hours refreshing the homepage, clicking through to a mix, listening, and heading back to the homepage to find another. I've never experienced anything like this on a website. It truly felt like I was exploring a vast archive similar to the experience of wandering through a book store and randomly choosing a title from a shelf. It was a completely new and exciting experience and it all came from a simple random function.

Though I doubt anything like Muxtape will ever exist again, I don't think the simple idea of exploring a website through randomization has to be completely lost. This design decision showed just how powerful randomization can be without any sort of machine learning or personalized algorithms.

<!--**Explore != Feed**

Explore pages are not feeds and they shouldn't be personalized. Explore pages should instead let you explore the depths of a website as the name implies.

One thing I find myself thinking when visiting websites today is how vast is this website? How many members are here? Who are they? How do I find something new here?

These are all questions that explore pages can answer.

I've been keeping track of some great examples of Explore pages which I'll add here.

Muxtape was the original "mixtape on the web" website. It allowed you to upload mp3s from your computer and curate the tracks into a "muxtape". Though the site was shutdown due to complaints from the RIAA, I still think about how unique the design was.

Muxtape's homepage had a "Random active muxtapes" section. This simple randomized section created very intriguing way to find new muxtapes on the website. Interestingly this feature alone replaced the need for search. The whole concept became about exploring and discovering instead of searching. I remember hours where I would keep refreshing the homepage, click into a muxtape, start listening, and head back to the homepage to find another. I've never experienced anything like this on the web. It was a completely new and exciting experience.-->
