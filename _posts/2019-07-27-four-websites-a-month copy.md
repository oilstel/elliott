*Update: I realized soon after posting this that I had to revise the rules. Instead of makes 4 websites per month, I will be publishing 4 projects per month. A "project" could just a some writing on this very blog or a series of photographs taken in a park.*

I'm passionate about personal websites and constantly have ideas for them. Instead of logging those ideas away, I'm hoping that for the next few months I can just make the ~~websites~~ projects I dream up. Often I get caught on something simple like choosing a domain name. ~~Instead of fussing over the details, I will be hosting each site here unless an obvious name immediately comes to mind.~~

*Some constraints (to follow or break):*
- Each ~~website~~ project should be simple enough to finish in a few days time.
- It would be nice if each project challenged me in a different way, but this is also not completely necessary. I'd rather finish each project instead of agonizing over the tooling.
- I'll document my progress in this post.

Stay tuned...

I rebuilt my studio site, [Bell Kiosk](http://bellkiosk.site). Each website is represented by a bell. You can ring all the bells from the homepage.

I've wanted to setup a webcam since I was a kid. This month I finally bought an Axis security camera and opened a port on my router. If its plugged in, you should see a live feed above.

I'm doing a residency with [Laurel](http://laurelschwulst.com/) at the creative space [∧°┐](http://vg.pe.hu/2f/greenpeople.html) until the end of July. 7/11 is everywhere here and each store has its own printing/copy kiosk. As a traveler its nice to just walk in and print images off your phone taken moments before. The photo printing is super glossy and comes in a variety of sizes. A while back I created an app for my phone called TNR writer (short for Times New Roman writer). The app is a simple text editor that saves out a square jpg. There's also a button that changes the background color to a randomly generated color. It's a nice way of making notes and posting them to another app or just storing them in the camera roll. I've been printing these text images at 7/11 and making packs of them. Each pack contains 5 words. I'm calling this project Rare Words, in that a word will only be printed once. The words are packaged in plastic sleeves so that its hard to tell what words are in each pack.

As the the residency at [∧°┐](http://vg.pe.hu/2f/greenpeople.html) (pe hu) came to a close the Green People (Laurel and Kazuma and I) held an exhibition. We created a minature diarama and I wrote a [short story](/green-world) on a [Pomera](https://www.amazon.com/KINGJIM-digital-memo-Pomela-Silva/dp/B07CYTVH4Z) about the Green People and their love of silver horses.
