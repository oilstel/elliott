I made Contemporary Art Blur (http://contemporaryartblur.com) while working as the Registrar/Archivist at a [gallery in San Francisco](https://ratio3.org/).

While working, the oceans rose flooding the galleries. The servers of archived photographs stopped running. The exhibition catalogues became wet; smudging the images into an unrecognizable blur.

Contemporary Art Blur creates another type of image, making the hi-res images of art into blotchy relics.

Questions:

* What forms of art cannot be documented in images?

* What other methods can we use to document or archive artistic endeavors?
