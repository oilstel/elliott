I made [Contemporary Art Blur](http://blur.website/gauss.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.contemporaryartdaily.com%2F) while working as the Registrar/Archivist at a [gallery in San Francisco](https://ratio3.org/). CAB is a blurry version of [Contemporary Art Daily](http://www.contemporaryartdaily.com/).

*While working, the oceans rose flooding the galleries. The servers of archived photographs stopped running. The exhibition catalogues became wet; smudging the images into an unrecognizable blur.*

Questions:

- What forms of art cannot be documented in images?
- What other methods can we use to document or archive artistic endeavors?
