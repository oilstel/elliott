Some thoughts on Patreon and Drip...

I feel like these platforms are catering to a very particular kind of artist, an artist who has an audience that is willing to pay for their content and not just view it. I suppose the Patreon artist is something YouTube helped create, an artist created by the audience for the audience. I just wonder how these platforms help artists that are not YouTube stars or musicians?

Artists primarily need funding and space. They need a free studio to work in and work relief so that they have time to focus on their art. In Europe this often happens through government backed grants. In the US thereâ€™s a lack of funded for artists. What if these companies used their position and money to lobby for arts funding from the government? Obviously this would be hard in the current administration but maybe this could also be done with private programs and grants. Imagine if the government or a bunch of tech companies were paying artists a living wage to just live and make their work.
