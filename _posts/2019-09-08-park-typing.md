There’s something interesting about writing in public. I love the feeling of typing on a keyboard and looking up to see the park and beyond that the entire world. It's great if you are searching for words. It reminds me a little of swimming in the ocean and seeing the horizon curving slightly in the distance. Both experiences create a similar state of mind.

I’m at the park early today. It's only 8:30. There’s an entirely different group of people here at this time. I've never been to the park this early. Most of these morning people are walking their dogs. I guess this is the time when the dog people come out. Is it just that dogs wake up early and need to do their business? Is it better for the dog people/dogs if they get this part done early in the morning? I wonder if all these dog people had to adjust the time they wake up when they got a dog. Is getting a dog the trick to getting up early? I’m so used to waking up late that being awake and typing at this time feels a bit odd. I just got back from Athens and I've been waking up early because of the time change. Being jet lagged is a wonderful thing. I’ve felt the most alive when I’ve been jet lagged. I heard once that when you fly, the plane travels so quickly that your soul can’t catch up with your body. I guess the jet lag part is you being detached from your soul. Though this is a pretty new agey idea, I like the concept of your soul having to catch up with your body. I wonder how it finds your body once you are in the new city. Is your soul still attached to your body with some kind of elastic cord? Maybe all the soul cords would look something like this...

Ah it's almost 9 now and the stroller people have arrived in the park. There’s also a family that looks like they might be here for a picnic. A Sunday morning picnic? Sounds a little early, but I can understand the allure if you live close to the park.
